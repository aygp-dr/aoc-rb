** Problem
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: problem
:END:
Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but
he can't find the right floor. The instructions he has are a sequence of
parentheses:

- =(= means go *up* one floor
- =)= means go *down* one floor

Santa starts on the ground floor (floor 0).

** Part 1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: part-1
:END:
*Task:* What floor do the instructions take Santa?

*** Examples
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: examples
:END:
| Input     | Result |
|-----------+--------|
| =(())=    | 0      |
| =()()=    | 0      |
| =(((=     | 3      |
| =(()(()(= | 3      |
| =))(((((= | 3      |
| =())=     | -1     |
| =))(=     | -1     |
| =)))=     | -3     |
| =)())())= | -3     |

** Part 2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: part-2
:END:
*Task:* Find the position of the character that causes Santa to first
enter the basement (floor -1). Positions are 1-indexed.

*** Examples
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: examples-1
:END:
| Input   | Result |
|---------+--------|
| =)=     | 1      |
| =()())= | 5      |

** Solution Approach
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: solution-approach
:END:
*** Part 1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: part-1-1
:END:
Simple character counting: count =(= as +1 and =)= as -1, sum all
values.

*** Part 2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: part-2-1
:END:
Iterate through characters tracking floor level. Return the 1-indexed
position when floor first becomes -1.
